# Minimal ncurses MUD Client in C

Minimum working code.  Uses ncurses to drive the terminal, `select()` for IO multiplexing, and janky ANSI color support.

Needs a bunch of work; mostly documented as TODOs in the source.  

Certainly needs refactored into proper functions instead of one blob of stuff in `main()`.
